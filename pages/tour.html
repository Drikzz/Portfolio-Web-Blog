                <b><i>Hello Manila! ✈️</i></b><br><br><b>June 08, 2025</b> - This day marks our arrival in Manila for our <b>Industry Immersion</b> tour. But, before starting our <b>Industry_Immersion</b> tour, we did a little <i>detour</i> - <b>Intramuros, Manila</b>.
                It is said the <b>Intramuros</b> used to be the <b>capital</b> of the Philippines during the <b> Spanish colonial period</b>. After exploring <b>Intramuros</b>, we headed to <b>SM MOA (Mall of Asia)</b> to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city.
                We're excited to kick off our tour tomorrow, where we'll be visiting various <b>tech companies</b> and learning about their work culture and projects.

                <b><i>Where Classroom Meets Reality: Day One at Foundever PH & Google PH </i></b><br><br><b>June 9, 2025</b> — The opening day of our industry tour unfolded with visits to <b>Foundever PH</b> and <b>Google Philippines</b>, giving us a front-row seat to how innovation drives modern business and public impact. At <b>Foundever</b>, we discovered how AI and data analytics shape customer experiences, explored cybersecurity in operations, and learned how the IT-BPM sector continues to fuel economic growth in the Philippines — all reinforced by insights from IBPAP.

                Later at <b>Google PH</b>, the conversation shifted to digital inclusion, ethical tech, and how public policy intersects with global innovation. With open lounges and smart workspaces all around, it was more than just a tour — it was a glimpse into how technology, collaboration, and purpose come together to build the future. Day One wasn't just informative — it was transformative.

At <b>TP PH</b>, we learned how human-centric tech meets global service excellence. <b>Ms. Beatrice Grace</b> Bonjibod shared how Teleperformance harnesses innovation and diversity to shape business solutions — with 53% of their workforce being women, TP's commitment to inclusion was front and center. Students toured the Innovation Hub and got practical HR insights, even participating in mock interviews to prepare for real-world roles. Later at <b>Kollab</b>, the energy shifted to AI, workplace culture, and creative development. Experts like <b>Ralph Regalado</b>, <b>Jazmine Calma</b>, <b>Toni Monserrat</b>, and <b>Miguel Siriban</b> showcased everything from applied AI to portfolio building — with honest stories, sharp advice, and encouragement for the future tech leaders in the room. From automation demos to snack chats, Kollab turned theory into inspiration. Day Two wasn't just a visit — it was an invitation to dream, design, and develop with purpose.

                <b><i>Day Four: From Mission-Driven Tech to Market-Ready Skills</i></b><br><br> <b>June 11, 2025</b> — Our fourth day of industry immersion brought together two distinct facets of the tech ecosystem. At the <b>Asian Development Bank (ADB)</b>, we explored how IT drives inclusive development across Asia and the Pacific. From engaging with global IT leaders in a fireside chat to showcasing our batchmates' fintech app <b>RePay</b>, the visit revealed how technology can empower underserved communities and support high-impact goals. We also got a glimpse into the <b>Future IT Leaders Program</b>—an exciting career track for emerging talent in mission-driven institutions. Later, we visited <b>MicroSourcing</b>, where tech meets scalability. CEO <b>Ms. Heidee Enriquez</b> emphasized the importance of continuous learning and digital professionalism. Their <b>LinkedIn Workshop</b> helped us build stronger online profiles, ready to connect with potential employers. The facility tour and branding tips painted a clearer picture of how outsourcing platforms thrive on adaptable, tech-savvy talent. Together, ADB and MicroSourcing showed us that real-world impact takes both purpose and polish—and we're gearing up to deliver both.

This day was all about reflection, relaxation, and enjoying the beautiful views. We visited the <b>People's Park in the Sky</b>, one of the tourist spots in Tagaytay City, and took in the breathtaking scenery. It was a perfect way to unwind after a week filled with learning and growth. As we enjoyed the cool breeze and stunning landscapes, we reflected on our experiences and the valuable lessons we've learned throughout the tour. This day reminded us of the importance of taking a step back to appreciate our journey and recharge for the challenges ahead.

We arrived 5am in the morning, we didn't not expect the cold weather, so we were not prepared for it. We already had our tour jackets, but it was not still not enough to keep us warm. We first visted <b>Strawberry Farm</b> and bought strawberry taho, some ube ice cream, and some pasalubong. After that, we went to <b>Bell Church</b> to enjoy the cool breeze and the beautiful scenery. We also visited <b>Philippines Military Academy</b>, where we roamed around the campus and experienced first hand the cadets' drill before leaving the campus. Moving forward, we also visited <b>Mines View Park</b>, we explored the local shops, tried to rent a tribe costume, and rode a horse. The day was filled with laughter, fun, and unforgettable memories as we enjoyed the unique charm of Baguio City.
