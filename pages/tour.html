                It is said the <b>Intramuros</b> used to be the <b>capital</b> of the Philippines during the <b> Spanish colonial period</b>. After exploring <b>Intramuros</b>, we headed to <b>SM MOA (Mall of Asia)</b> to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city.
                We're excited to kick off our tour tomorrow, where we'll be visiting various <b>tech companies</b> and learning about their work culture and projects.

At Foundever, we discovered how AI and data analytics shape customer experiences, explored cybersecurity in operations, and learned how the IT-BPM sector continues to fuel economic growth in the Philippines—all reinforced by insights from IBPAP.

                Later at Google PH, the conversation shifted to digital inclusion, ethical tech, and how public policy intersects with global innovation. With open lounges and smart workspaces all around, it was more than just a tour—it was a glimpse into how technology, collaboration, and purpose come together to build the future. Day One wasn't just informative—it was transformative.

At TP PH, we learned how human-centric tech meets global service excellence. Ms. Beatrice Grace Bonjibod shared how Teleperformance harnesses innovation and diversity to shape business solutions—with 53% of their workforce being women, TP's commitment to inclusion was front and center. Students toured the Innovation Hub and got practical HR insights, even participating in mock interviews to prepare for real-world roles. Later at Kollab, the energy shifted to AI, workplace culture, and creative development. Experts like <b>Ralph Regalado</b>, <b>Jazmine Calma</b>, <b>Toni Monserrat</b>, and <b>Miguel Siriban</b> showcased everything from applied AI to portfolio building—with honest stories, sharp advice, and encouragement for the future tech leaders in the room. From automation demos to snack chats, Kollab turned theory into inspiration. Day Two wasn't just a visit—it was an invitation to dream, design, and develop with purpose.
